Welcome to the Forest Cover Type Classification Project. This repository contains all the necessary files for the machine learning project aimed at classifying forest cover types using cartographic variables. Our goal is to apply different machine learning techniques to create a predictive model based on the Roosevelt National Forest data.

Repository Contents
- ML_Project.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains the Python code for the entire machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- Presentation.pdf: A presentation outlining the project's goals, methodology, findings, and conclusions. It includes visualizations and key metrics for the machine learning models evaluated.
- Report.pdf: A detailed report containing the comprehensive findings of the study, including data analysis, model implementation, results, and discussion of the practical implications of the work conducted.
